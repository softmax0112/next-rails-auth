# FRONTEND 
# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.2)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) or preview live with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss&project-name=with-tailwindcss&repository-name=with-tailwindcss)

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-tailwindcss with-tailwindcss-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

Notes on frontend:
  - If using getServersideProps, make sure that you use the appropriate backend service name instead of localhost in your fetch
    - Ex. 'http://api:3000'

### Initialize
```rails new <project-name> --database=postgresql --api```
should replace project name with api. If change, make sure to change in the docker-compose file as well.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

### Initial Setup
- Install rack-cors, and add your appropriate origins:
  - http://localhost:8000, http://app:8000
- Within config/environments/development, add config.hosts.clear to the bottom of the file
